# Unified Calendar Aggregator Plan

## Project Overview
Build a unified calendar system that aggregates calendars from multiple sources and provides real-time updates when any source calendar changes.

## Calendar Sources
1. **Outlook/Exchange** - K-State University calendar
2. **Trademan Enterprise** - Business calendar
3. **Targon LLC** - Business calendar
4. **Personal Calendar** - Personal events

## Core Features
- Single dashboard showing all calendars
- Real-time sync when source calendars change
- Change notifications
- Conflict detection between calendars
- Secure authentication for each calendar source

## Technical Architecture

### Design Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern** - Unified interface for different calendar systems
- **Event-driven Architecture** - Webhooks and background workers
- **Repository Pattern** - Data persistence layer

### Sync Strategy
- **Webhooks** - For real-time updates (where supported)
- **Polling** - Fallback for systems without webhooks
- **Caching** - Reduce API calls and improve performance

### Authentication
- **OAuth2** - Microsoft Graph API for Outlook
- **API Keys** - For proprietary systems
- **Secure credential storage** - Environment variables and secrets management

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Research and document calendar APIs for each source
2. Design unified calendar data model and sync architecture
3. Set up project structure and core dependencies
4. Create calendar adapter pattern for different systems

### Phase 2: Authentication & Security
1. Implement OAuth2 flows for Microsoft Graph API (Outlook)
2. Add authentication and security for each calendar source
3. Set up secure credential management

### Phase 3: Calendar Integrations
1. Implement Outlook/Exchange calendar integration for K-State
2. Implement Trademan Enterprise calendar integration
3. Implement Targon LLC calendar integration
4. Implement personal calendar integration

### Phase 4: Real-time Sync
1. Set up webhook endpoints for calendar change notifications
2. Implement real-time change detection and notifications
3. Set up background sync workers for polling-based calendars

### Phase 5: User Interface
1. Create unified calendar view UI
2. Implement data persistence and caching
3. Add calendar event conflict detection

## Technical Stack (Proposed)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Python with REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for event storage
- **Cache**: Redis for performance
- **Queue**: Bull/Celery for background jobs
- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js for dashboard
- **Authentication**: OAuth2, JWT tokens

## API Research Notes

### Microsoft Graph API (Outlook)
- Endpoint: `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/calendar/events`
- Auth: OAuth2 with Azure AD
- Supports webhooks for real-time updates

### Other Calendars
- Need to research specific APIs for Trademan Enterprise and Targon LLC
- Personal calendar could be Google Calendar, iCal, or other

## Security Considerations
- Encrypted storage of API credentials
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- User access controls and permissions
- Audit logging for calendar access

## Next Steps
1. Confirm calendar API access for each source
2. Set up development environment
3. Create proof of concept for Microsoft Graph API integration
4. Design database schema for unified calendar storage
