## Test Categories

### 1. Security Tests (`/security`)

These tests verify that all security vulnerabilities have been properly addressed:

- **auth-vulnerability.test.ts**: Tests authentication bypass prevention, USE_TEST_AUTH vulnerability fix
- **csrf-protection.test.ts**: Verifies CSRF token validation and cross-origin request protection
- **rate-limiting.test.ts**: Tests rate limiting effectiveness on API endpoints
- **access-control.test.ts**: Verifies endpoint access control
- **permission-based-access.test.ts**: Tests role-based permission system

### 2. Data Integrity Tests (`/data-integrity`)

These tests ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions:

- **concurrent-requests.test.ts**: Simulates concurrent inventory operations to prove race conditions are fixed
- **idempotency.test.ts**: Tests idempotency key functionality for preventing duplicate transactions
- **transaction-validation.test.ts**: Validates transaction date constraints and data validation
- **reconciliation-accuracy.test.ts**: Tests inventory reconciliation accuracy and audit trail

### 3. Performance Tests (`/performance`)

These tests establish baselines and measure optimization improvements:

- **baseline-metrics.test.ts**: Establishes performance baselines before optimization
- **optimization-comparison.test.ts**: Compares performance before/after caching and indexing

### 4. Integration Tests (`/integration`)

These tests verify complete workflows:

- **inventory-flow.test.ts**: Tests complete inventory workflows (receive, ship, transfer)

### 5. Unit Tests (`/unit`)

These tests verify individual components:

- **services/inventory-service.test.ts**: Tests core inventory service functionality

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Security tests only
npm test -- tests/security

# Data integrity tests only
npm test -- tests/data-integrity

# Performance tests only
npm test -- tests/performance

# Integration tests only
npm test -- tests/integration

# Unit tests only
npm test -- tests/unit
```

### Run Individual Test Files
```bash
# Run concurrent request tests
npm test -- tests/data-integrity/concurrent-requests.test.ts

# Run performance comparison
npm test -- tests/performance/optimization-comparison.test.ts
```

## Performance Testing

### Baseline Performance Test
Run this before implementing optimizations:
```bash
npm test -- tests/performance/baseline-metrics.test.ts
```

### Optimization Comparison Test
Run this after implementing caching and indexing:
```bash
npm test -- tests/performance/optimization-comparison.test.ts
```

Performance reports are saved to `/performance-reports/` directory.

## Test Coverage

### Security Coverage
- ✅ Authentication vulnerability (USE_TEST_AUTH bypass)
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Permission-based access control
- ✅ Session security
- ✅ Input sanitization

### Data Integrity Coverage
- ✅ Concurrent transaction handling
- ✅ Idempotency for critical operations
- ✅ Transaction date validation
- ✅ Inventory reconciliation
- ✅ Audit trail verification
- ✅ Race condition prevention

### Performance Coverage
- ✅ Dashboard query optimization
- ✅ Pagination performance
- ✅ Cache effectiveness
- ✅ Database index usage
- ✅ Concurrent request handling
- ✅ Memory usage patterns

## Key Test Scenarios

### 1. Concurrent Inventory Operations
Tests prove that multiple simultaneous shipments cannot oversell inventory:
```typescript
// See: tests/data-integrity/concurrent-requests.test.ts
// Scenario: 5 concurrent shipments of 300 units each (1500 total)
// Available: 1000 units
// Expected: Only 3 shipments succeed
```

### 2. Idempotent Payment Processing
Tests prove duplicate payment requests are prevented:
```typescript
// See: tests/data-integrity/idempotency.test.ts
// Scenario: Same payment request sent 10 times concurrently
// Expected: Only one payment is processed
```

### 3. Performance Improvements
Tests quantify optimization benefits:
```typescript
// See: tests/performance/optimization-comparison.test.ts
// Dashboard Stats: 50%+ improvement with caching
// Search Queries: Improved with full-text indexing
// Deep Pagination: Maintains performance at page 100+
```

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Pre-commit**: Unit tests
2. **Pull Request**: Unit + Integration tests
3. **Pre-deployment**: Full test suite including performance
4. **Post-deployment**: Smoke tests + critical path tests

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests:

1. Place in appropriate category directory
2. Follow naming convention: `<feature>.test.ts`
3. Include descriptive test names
4. Add to relevant test configuration
5. Update this README with new coverage

## Test Database

Tests use a separate test database configured via environment variables:
- Security tests: Mock authentication
- Data integrity tests: Transactional rollback
- Performance tests: Seeded test data
- Integration tests: Full application context

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Ensure test database is running
   - Check DATABASE_URL in test environment

2. **Performance Test Timeouts**
   - Increase jest timeout for performance tests
   - Run performance tests separately

3. **Flaky Concurrent Tests**
   - Use proper test isolation
   - Clear database state between tests

## Contributing

When contributing tests:
1. Ensure tests are deterministic
2. Use proper cleanup in afterAll/afterEach
3. Mock external dependencies
4. Follow existing patterns
5. Document complex test scenarios
