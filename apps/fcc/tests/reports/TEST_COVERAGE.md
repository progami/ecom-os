# Report Pages Test Coverage

This document summarizes the comprehensive Playwright E2E tests created for all report pages.

## Test Files Created

### 1. comprehensive-reports-e2e.spec.ts
Main end-to-end test suite covering all report pages (profit-loss, balance-sheet, cash-flow, trial-balance, general-ledger).

**Test Coverage:**
- Page loading and title verification
- UI element presence (headers, buttons, filters)
- Filter functionality (search, source, status, date range)
- Import history table display
- Empty state handling
- API error handling
- Fetch from Xero functionality
- Export to CSV functionality
- View details modal
- Navigation to import pages
- Date picker functionality
- Delete functionality
- Mobile responsiveness
- Cross-report navigation
- Performance benchmarks
- Accessibility compliance

### 2. report-import-functionality.spec.ts
Focused tests for the import functionality across all report types.

**Test Coverage:**
- Import page navigation
- File upload functionality
- CSV file validation
- File type validation
- Import history refresh
- Date period selection
- Import progress indicators
- Error handling
- Data preview/mapping
- Bulk import operations
- Authentication requirements
- Template downloads
- Mobile import experience
- Permission-based features
- Data validation
- Undo/rollback options

### 3. report-ui-components.spec.ts
Detailed tests for UI components and interactions.

**Test Coverage:**
- ReportDataHistory component rendering
- Status icons (success, failed, processing)
- Source icons (manual, API)
- Loading skeleton states
- Xero connection tooltips
- Number formatting
- Relative time display
- Import details modal
- Filter interactions and persistence
- Responsive table behavior
- Mobile UI adjustments
- Data table features (sorting, sticky headers)
- Error states and messages
- Toast notifications
- Loading overlays
- Breadcrumb navigation

## Running the Tests

### Run all report tests:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/reports/
```

### Run specific test files:
```bash
# Comprehensive E2E tests
npx playwright test tests/reports/comprehensive-reports-e2e.spec.ts

# Import functionality tests
npx playwright test tests/reports/report-import-functionality.spec.ts

# UI component tests
npx playwright test tests/reports/report-ui-components.spec.ts
```

### Run tests for specific report:
```bash
# Example: Run only Balance Sheet tests
npx playwright test tests/reports/comprehensive-reports-e2e.spec.ts -g "Balance Sheet"
```

### Run tests in headed mode:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/reports/ --headed
```

### Run tests with UI mode:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/reports/ --ui
```

## Test Structure

Each test suite follows best practices:
- Proper setup and teardown with `beforeEach` and `afterEach`
- Runtime error tracking and validation
- Mock API responses for consistent testing
- Responsive design testing with viewport changes
- Screenshot capture for visual verification
- Comprehensive assertions for all UI elements
- Performance monitoring
- Accessibility compliance checks

## Key Features Tested

1. **Data Display**
   - Import history tables
   - Filtering and searching
   - Pagination (if applicable)
   - Empty states

2. **User Actions**
   - Import data via file upload
   - Fetch from Xero API
   - Export to CSV
   - Delete imports
   - View import details

3. **UI/UX**
   - Responsive design
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Toast notifications
   - Modal dialogs

4. **Integration**
   - API mocking
   - Authentication flows
   - Navigation between pages
   - Data persistence

## Maintenance Notes

- Tests use data-testid attributes where available
- Fallback selectors for flexibility
- Mock data is realistic and comprehensive
- Tests are isolated and can run independently
- Performance benchmarks may need adjustment based on environment

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Visual regression testing
- API contract testing
- Load testing for large data sets
- Cross-browser compatibility matrix
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Test result reporting dashboard
