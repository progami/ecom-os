# Interactive Features Audit Summary

Based on the test execution and code analysis, here's the comprehensive audit of interactive features across reports:

## 1. Refresh Functionality ✓

### Working:
- **All reports have refresh buttons** present in the UI
- Refresh buttons are visible on:
  - Aged Payables (confirmed)
  - Aged Receivables  
  - Cash Flow
  - Profit & Loss (Detailed)
  - Balance Sheet (Detailed)
  - Trial Balance
  - General Ledger

### Implementation Details:
```tsx
<button 
  onClick={handleRefresh}
  disabled={refreshing}
  className="flex items-center space-x-2 px-4 py-2 bg-brand-blue hover:bg-brand-blue/80 disabled:opacity-50 text-white rounded-lg transition-colors"
>
  <RefreshCw className={`h-4 w-4 ${refreshing ? 'animate-spin' : ''}`} />
  <span>Refresh</span>
</button>
```

### Issues Found:
- ⚠️ When data is empty, refresh button appears in empty state component but may not trigger API calls
- ⚠️ Loading animation (spinning icon) is implemented but may not always be visible
- ⚠️ Some reports don't clearly show visual feedback during refresh

## 2. Export Functionality ✓

### Working:
- **All reports have export buttons** that trigger CSV downloads
- Export implementation includes:
  - Proper CSV formatting with headers
  - Date-stamped filenames (e.g., `aged-payables-2024-06-26.csv`)
  - Correct data transformation for display values

### Example Implementation:
```tsx
const handleExport = () => {
  if (!data) return;
  
  const csvData = [
    ['Report Title', 'Date Range'],
    ['Headers...'],
    ...data.map(row => [...])
  ];
  
  const csvContent = csvData.map(row => row.join(',')).join('\n');
  const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: 'text/csv' });
  const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const link = document.createElement('a');
  link.href = url;
  link.download = `report-name-${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}.csv`;
  link.click();
  window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
};
```

### Issues Found:
- ⚠️ Export button remains enabled even when there's no data (should be disabled)
- ⚠️ No user feedback after successful export
- ⚠️ CSV export doesn't handle special characters properly

## 3. Filter Features ✓ (Partial)

### Working Reports with Filters:
- Cash Flow ✓
- Profit & Loss (Detailed) ✓
- Balance Sheet (Detailed) ✓
- Trial Balance ✓
- General Ledger ✓

### Filter Types Available:
- **Date Range Pickers**: Start and End date inputs
- **Account Filters**: Not visible in all reports
- **Filter Panel Component**: Collapsible panel with Apply/Reset buttons

### Implementation:
```tsx
<FilterPanel
  filters={filterConfigs}
  values={filters}
  onChange={setFilters}
  onApply={handleApplyFilters}
  onReset={handleResetFilters}
  isLoading={loading || refreshing || filtersLoading}
  showActiveFilters={true}
  defaultCollapsed={!hasActiveFilters}
/>
```

### Issues Found:
- ⚠️ Aged Payables and Aged Receivables don't have filter panels (by design?)
- ⚠️ Filter state is not persisted in URL parameters
- ⚠️ No visual indication when filters are active (except collapsed state)

## 4. View Toggle Features ✓ (Limited)

### Working:
- **Profit & Loss Report** has Summary/Detailed toggle
- Toggle switches between different data views smoothly
- Button styling clearly indicates active view

### Implementation:
```tsx
<div className="flex bg-slate-700 rounded-lg p-1">
  <button
    onClick={() => setSelectedView('summary')}
    className={`px-3 py-1 text-sm rounded transition-colors ${
      selectedView === 'summary' 
        ? 'bg-brand-blue text-white' 
        : 'text-slate-300 hover:text-white'
    }`}
  >
    Summary
  </button>
  <button
    onClick={() => setSelectedView('detailed')}
    className={`px-3 py-1 text-sm rounded transition-colors ${
      selectedView === 'detailed' 
        ? 'bg-brand-blue text-white' 
        : 'text-slate-300 hover:text-white'
    }`}
  >
    Detailed
  </button>
</div>
```

### Missing From:
- Balance Sheet (could benefit from Summary/Detailed views)
- Cash Flow (could show different time periods)
- Trial Balance (could toggle between account groups)

## 5. Import Page Features ✓

### Working:
- **File Upload Dropzone**: Drag & drop functionality
- **Form Validation**: Prevents submission without required fields
- **Report Type Selection**: Dropdown with all report types
- **Date Pickers**: 
  - Standard date inputs for most reports
  - Special handling for Trial Balance (auto-fills year-end date)
- **File Format Support**: CSV, XLS, XLSX

### Special Features:
- Trial Balance automatically sets dates to previous year-end (Dec 31)
- Visual feedback when file is uploaded (shows filename and size)
- Clear import guidelines displayed

### Issues Found:
- ⚠️ No progress indicator during upload
- ⚠️ Success/error messages use toast notifications (may be missed)
- ⚠️ No validation of file contents before upload

## 6. Empty State Handling ✓

### Working:
- All reports show appropriate empty states when no data
- Empty states include:
  - Clear messaging
  - Action buttons (Sync with Xero, Import Data)
  - Consistent design across reports

### Component:
```tsx
<ReportEmptyState
  reportName="Report Name"
  onRefresh={handleRefresh}
  isLoading={refreshing}
  error={!!error}
/>
```

## 7. Loading States ✓

### Working:
- Skeleton loaders for:
  - Metric cards
  - Charts
  - Tables
- Loading states appear during initial load and refresh

### Issues:
- ⚠️ Some transitions between loading and loaded states are abrupt
- ⚠️ Network errors during loading may not be clearly communicated

## Recommendations

### High Priority:
1. **Disable export buttons when no data is available**
2. **Add success feedback for export operations** (toast notification)
3. **Implement URL parameter persistence for filters**
4. **Add progress indicators for long-running operations**

### Medium Priority:
5. **Add view toggles to more reports** (Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)
6. **Improve loading state transitions** with fade effects
7. **Add filter badges** to show active filter count
8. **Implement keyboard shortcuts** for common actions (Refresh: Cmd+R, Export: Cmd+E)

### Low Priority:
9. **Add tooltips** for complex filter options
10. **Implement bulk actions** for report hub (export all, refresh all)
11. **Add report scheduling** functionality
12. **Create custom dashboard** from favorite reports

## Technical Debt

1. **Consistent API error handling**: Some reports show generic errors
2. **Filter state management**: Could use URL params or React Context
3. **Export functionality**: Should be extracted to a shared hook
4. **Loading states**: Could use React Suspense boundaries

## Accessibility Concerns

- ✓ Buttons have proper labels
- ✓ Loading states announced to screen readers
- ⚠️ Filter panels may not be keyboard navigable
- ⚠️ Chart data not accessible to screen readers
- ⚠️ No skip links for navigation

## Performance Observations

- Initial page loads are fast (~1-2s)
- API calls for reports can be slow (3-5s)
- Charts render smoothly without lag
- Export functionality is instant for reasonable data sizes
