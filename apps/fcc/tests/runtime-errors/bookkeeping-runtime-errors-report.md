# Bookkeeping Pages Runtime Error Report

## Test Overview
This report documents runtime errors found when testing the bookkeeping pages with the `dev_bypass=true` parameter.

## Pages Tested
1. `/bookkeeping` - Main bookkeeping hub
2. `/bookkeeping/chart-of-accounts` - Chart of Accounts page
3. `/bookkeeping/sop-generator` - SOP Generator page
4. `/bookkeeping/sop-tables` - SOP Tables page

## Runtime Errors Found

### Chart of Accounts Page (`/bookkeeping/chart-of-accounts`)

#### Console Errors:
1. **API Error - Missing Endpoint**
   - Error: `[Network Error] {url: /api/v1/xero/sync-gl-accounts, method: GET, status: 404, statusText: Not Found}`
   - Cause: The API endpoint `/api/v1/xero/sync-gl-accounts` returns 404
   - Impact: Chart of accounts cannot load account data
   - Error Message: `Error fetching accounts: Error: Failed to fetch accounts`

#### Network Errors:
1. **404 Error**: `https://localhost:3003/api/v1/xero/sync-gl-accounts` - Endpoint not found
2. **Connection Aborted**: Multiple API health check endpoints failing:
   - `/api/health`
   - `/api/v1/xero/status`
   - `/api/v1/database/status`
   - `/api/v1/auth/session`

### SOP Tables Page (`/bookkeeping/sop-tables`)

#### Console Errors:
1. **JavaScript Type Error**
   - Error: `Error loading SOPs: TypeError: dbSops.forEach is not a function`
   - Location: `app/bookkeeping/sop-tables/page.tsx:56:24`
   - Cause: The `dbSops` variable is not an array as expected
   - Impact: SOP tables cannot be displayed

### Main Bookkeeping Hub (`/bookkeeping`)

#### Network Errors:
1. **404 Error**: `https://localhost:3003/api/v1/bookkeeping/bank-accounts` - Endpoint not found
2. **Connection Aborted**: Same health check endpoints failing as other pages

### SOP Generator Page (`/bookkeeping/sop-generator`)
- No specific runtime errors detected
- Page loads successfully with status 200
- Same network errors for health check endpoints

## Common Issues Across All Pages

### Network Connectivity Issues:
All pages experience `net::ERR_ABORTED` errors for:
- `/api/health`
- `/api/v1/xero/status`
- `/api/v1/database/status`
- `/api/v1/auth/session`

These appear to be health check or status endpoints that are being called but failing to connect.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Missing API Endpoints**:
   - Implement `/api/v1/xero/sync-gl-accounts` endpoint for Chart of Accounts
   - Implement `/api/v1/bookkeeping/bank-accounts` endpoint for Bookkeeping hub

2. **Fix JavaScript Errors**:
   - In `/app/bookkeeping/sop-tables/page.tsx`, ensure `dbSops` is always an array before calling `forEach()`
   - Add proper error handling and type checking

3. **Address Network Issues**:
   - Investigate why health check endpoints are failing
   - Consider implementing proper error boundaries for failed API calls

4. **Add Loading States**:
   - Implement proper loading states while data is being fetched
   - Add error states when API calls fail

## Test Execution Notes

- The test successfully navigated to all pages with `dev_bypass=true`
- All pages loaded with HTTP 200 status
- Interactive elements were tested where possible
- Some hover actions timed out due to elements being outside viewport
- Screenshots were captured for each page for debugging purposes

## Summary

The bookkeeping section has several critical issues:
- 2 missing API endpoints causing functionality failures
- 1 JavaScript type error preventing SOP tables from loading
- Multiple network connectivity issues with health check endpoints

These issues should be addressed to ensure the bookkeeping functionality works correctly.
