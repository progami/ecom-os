# Runtime Error Detection Test Results

## Summary
All report pages have been tested for runtime errors and **no errors were detected**. The application is stable and functioning correctly.

## Test Coverage

### Pages Tested
1. **Reports Hub** (`/reports`)
   - ✅ No runtime errors
   - 14 buttons, 1 link found
   - Load time: ~2.3s

2. **Balance Sheet** (`/reports/balance-sheet`)
   - ✅ No runtime errors
   - 14 buttons, 2 links found
   - Load time: ~2.3s

3. **Profit & Loss** (`/reports/profit-loss`)
   - ✅ No runtime errors
   - 9 buttons found
   - Load time: ~2.3s

4. **Cash Flow** (`/reports/cash-flow`)
   - ✅ No runtime errors
   - 9 buttons found
   - Load time: ~2.3s

5. **Trial Balance** (`/reports/trial-balance`)
   - ✅ No runtime errors
   - 9 buttons found
   - Load time: ~2.2s

6. **General Ledger** (`/reports/general-ledger`)
   - ✅ No runtime errors
   - 9 buttons found
   - Load time: ~2.1s

7. **Import Reports** (`/reports/import`)
   - ✅ No runtime errors
   - 12 buttons, 2 links, 1 input, 1 select found
   - Load time: ~2.1s

## Error Types Monitored
- **Console Errors**: JavaScript runtime errors
- **Network Errors**: HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses
- **Page Errors**: Uncaught exceptions
- **Failed Requests**: Network failures

## Key Findings
1. **No JavaScript Errors**: All pages load without console errors
2. **Clean Network Traffic**: No unexpected HTTP errors (auth/health endpoints excluded)
3. **Stable UI**: All interactive elements are present and accessible
4. **Consistent Load Times**: All pages load within 2-2.3 seconds
5. **Proper Structure**: All pages have header and main content areas

## Test Files Created
- `/tests/runtime-errors/reports-errors.spec.ts` - Basic runtime error detection
- `/tests/runtime-errors/reports-detailed-check.spec.ts` - Detailed page analysis

## Running the Tests
```bash
# Run all runtime error tests
npm test -- tests/runtime-errors/

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/runtime-errors/reports-errors.spec.ts

# Run with specific browser
npm test -- tests/runtime-errors/reports-errors.spec.ts --project=chromium
```

## Next Steps
The runtime error detection tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline to ensure ongoing stability of the report pages.
