# Logout Functionality Test Results & Fix

## Summary of Testing

I tested the logout functionality across the application and found:

### Issues Found

1. **UnifiedPageHeader had incorrect logout behavior**
   - The logout button was calling `disconnectFromXero()` instead of `signOut()`
   - This only disconnected the Xero integration, not logging out the user
   - Users remained authenticated and could continue using the app

### Logout Locations

1. **Sidebar Navigation** (/components/ui/sidebar-navigation.tsx)
   - ✅ Correctly calls `signOut()` from AuthContext
   - Located at bottom of sidebar
   - Shows user info with "Sign Out" button

2. **UnifiedPageHeader** (/components/ui/unified-page-header.tsx)
   - ❌ WAS: Calling `disconnectFromXero()` 
   - ✅ NOW: Fixed to call `signOut()`
   - Red logout button with LogOut icon
   - Visible when `showAuthStatus=true` and `hasActiveToken=true`

3. **XeroConnectionStatus** (/components/xero/xero-connection-status.tsx)
   - ✅ Correctly shows "Disconnect" for Xero only
   - Dropdown menu with disconnect option
   - Properly scoped to Xero connection management

### Logout Flow

1. User clicks "Sign Out" button
2. `signOut()` is called from AuthContext
3. Makes POST request to `/api/v1/auth/signout`
4. Server clears all auth cookies:
   - `user_session`
   - `xero_token`
   - `xero_state`
   - `xero_pkce`
5. AuthContext clears state
6. User is redirected to `/login`

### Changes Made

1. **Fixed UnifiedPageHeader component**:
   - Changed `onClick={disconnectFromXero}` to `onClick={signOut}`
   - Updated tooltip from "Disconnect from Xero" to "Sign Out"
   - Added `signOut` to the destructured auth methods

2. **Enhanced signout route logging**:
   - Added logging for incoming cookies
   - Added explicit clearing of `xero_token` cookie
   - Added completion logging

### Test Results

- Created test page at `/test-logout` to demonstrate the issue
- Verified sidebar logout works correctly
- Fixed UnifiedPageHeader logout button
- Confirmed proper cookie clearing in signout route

### Affected Pages

Pages using UnifiedPageHeader with `showAuthStatus=true`:
- `/finance` - Financial Overview page
- `/reports/profit-loss` - Enhanced Profit & Loss report
- Any other pages using UnifiedPageHeader with auth status enabled

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding a confirmation dialog for logout to prevent accidental logouts
2. Add visual distinction between "Disconnect Xero" and "Sign Out" actions
3. Consider adding session timeout with auto-logout
4. Add audit logging for logout events for security tracking
