Deploy specialized Task agents to exhaustively validate:

**Core Financial Tables:**
1. 5-Year Financial Projections (Table 8.1)
2. Investment Breakdown (Table 1.1)
3. Year 1 Phased Projections
4. Monthly Cash Flow Analysis
5. Product Margins by SKU
6. Retail vs E-commerce Revenue Split
7. Employment & Salary Projections

**Cross-Table Validation:**
1. Verify total revenue consistency across all tables mentioning revenue
2. Ensure COGS calculations align with product margins
3. Validate that salary expenses match employment tables
4. Confirm operating expenses are consistent throughout
5. Check that Net Operating Income calculations are accurate
6. Verify investment amounts match across all references
7. Ensure growth rates are consistently applied

**Deep Financial Analysis:**
1. Validate ALL mathematical calculations line by line
2. Check every percentage calculation (margins, growth rates, ROI)
3. Verify cumulative calculations (retained earnings, cumulative NOI)
4. Ensure working capital calculations are accurate
5. Validate inventory turnover and cash conversion cycles
6. Check break-even analysis and profitability timeline
7. Verify all currency formatting ($X,XXX,XXX)

**Business Logic Validation:**
1. Ensure retail margins (40-50%) align with revenue projections
2. Verify e-commerce margins (65-70%) are consistently applied
3. Check that expansion timeline matches financial projections
4. Validate that employment growth supports revenue growth
5. Ensure manufacturing transition economics make sense
6. Verify that all assumptions are realistic and defendable

Use ultrathinking to:
- Identify subtle inconsistencies between related metrics
- Spot unrealistic growth projections or margins
- Detect calculation errors that propagate through multiple tables
- Verify that all financial relationships hold true

**CRITICAL: Present findings to user for approval**

Provide a detailed report with:
- Specific discrepancies found (with table/row/column references)
- Recommended corrections
- Risk assessment of any issues found
- Proposed fixes for each issue

**STOP AND WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL**

Ask explicitly: "I've found [X] financial discrepancies. Here are the proposed corrections: [list]. Would you like me to proceed with fixing these issues?"

**ONLY proceed with fixes after receiving explicit user approval**

If approved, use MultiEdit to:
- Correct calculation errors
- Update inconsistent values
- Fix formatting issues
- Ensure all financial relationships are accurate
