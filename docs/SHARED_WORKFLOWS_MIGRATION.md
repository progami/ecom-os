# Shared Workflows Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated both `master` and `WMS` repositories to use shared workflows from the new `progami/shared-workflows` repository. This reduces code duplication by ~70% and ensures consistency across all Targon repositories.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Shared Workflows Repository
- Repository: [progami/shared-workflows](https://github.com/progami/shared-workflows)
- Contains 4 reusable workflows:
  - `ci-base.yml` - Build, lint, type check, and security scanning
  - `deploy-ssh.yml` - SSH-based deployment with PM2
  - `test-suite.yml` - Comprehensive test runner
  - `pr-checks.yml` - PR validation and automation

### 2. Updated Master Repository
- **Before**: 90 lines across 2 workflows
- **After**: 35 lines across 3 workflows
- **Added**: PR checks workflow for better PR validation
- **Configuration**:
  - Node.js 18 (no TypeScript)
  - PM2 app: `targon-frontend`
  - Deploy path: `/home/ecom-os`
  - Health check: https://targonglobal.com

### 3. Updated WMS Repository
- **Before**: 600+ lines across 2 workflows
- **After**: 180 lines across 3 workflows
- **Preserved**: All functionality including performance tests
- **Configuration**:
  - Node.js 20 with TypeScript
  - PM2 app: `wms-app`
  - Deploy path: `/home/wms/app`
  - Health check: http://localhost:3001/api/health
  - PostgreSQL + Redis services

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test CI Workflows

```bash
# In master repository
cd /Users/jarraramjad/Documents/ecom_os/master
git add .github/
git commit -m "ci: migrate to shared workflows"
git push origin main

# In WMS repository  
cd /Users/jarraramjad/Documents/ecom_os/WMS
git add .github/
git commit -m "ci: migrate to shared workflows"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Test PR Checks

Create a test PR in either repository to verify:
- PR title validation
- Size labeling
- File analysis comments

### 3. Test Manual Deployment

```bash
# Trigger manual deployment from GitHub Actions UI
# Navigate to Actions > Deploy to Production > Run workflow
```

### 4. Verify Shared Workflow Updates

Any updates to shared workflows will automatically apply to all repositories using them:

```bash
# Example: Update Node version in shared workflow
cd shared-workflows
# Edit .github/workflows/ci-base.yml
git commit -am "chore: update default Node to 22"
git push
# All repos will use Node 22 on next run
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All repos use identical CI/CD patterns
2. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for workflows
3. **Efficiency**: ~70% reduction in workflow code
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to update all repos at once
5. **Scalability**: New repos can adopt workflows instantly

## Next Steps

1. Monitor initial workflow runs for any issues
2. Add more repos to use shared workflows
3. Consider adding more shared workflows:
   - `docker-build.yml` for containerized apps
   - `dependency-update.yml` for automated updates
   - `code-coverage.yml` for coverage reporting

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the original workflow files are preserved in Git history:

```bash
# Rollback to previous workflows
git revert HEAD
git push
```

## Repository Status

- âœ… `progami/shared-workflows` - Created and configured
- âœ… `master` - Migrated to shared workflows
- âœ… `WMS` - Migrated to shared workflows
- ðŸ”„ Testing - Ready for deployment verification
