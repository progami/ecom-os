# Plutus Implementation Plan v2

## Overview

Hybrid accounting system for Amazon FBA business using Link My Books (LMB) + Plutus.

**Business:**
- Amazon seller (US + UK marketplaces in single QBO)
- 2 brands currently: UK-Dust Sheets, US-Dust Sheets (US-Shoe Bag future)
- 12 SKUs total (4 US, 8 UK) with 3 shared ASINs between regions
- FBA only
- Single-member LLC (Targon LLC)
- Uses 3PL storage in US

**Goal:**
- Brand-level P&L that adds up 100% to total P&L
- COGS broken into components with full visibility
- Accurate inventory accounting (asset → COGS when sold)
- Automation, minimal manual work

### Responsibility Split

| System | Data Source | Posts to QBO |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| LMB | Settlement Report | Revenue, Refunds, Fees (by brand via Product Groups) |
| Plutus | Settlement Report (SP-API) | COGS (by brand, by component) |
| Plutus | FBA Inventory Report | Reconciliation adjustments |
| Plutus | QBO Bills | Landed cost extraction |

---

## Brands

| Brand | Marketplace | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| UK-Dust Sheets | Amazon.co.uk | Active |
| US-Dust Sheets | Amazon.com | Active |
| US-Shoe Bag | Amazon.com | Future |

---

## COGS Components

| Component | Description | Goes to Inventory Asset? |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Manufacturing | Product cost from supplier | Yes |
| Freight | International shipping (sea/air freight) | Yes |
| Duty | Import duty/customs charges | Yes |
| Mfg Accessories | Packaging, labels, inserts | Yes |
| Land Freight | Local shipping (3PL → Amazon FC) | No (direct expense) |
| Storage 3PL | 3PL warehouse storage fees | No (direct expense) |

**Note:** Land Freight and Storage 3PL go directly to COGS when billed (not capitalized to inventory) because they're period costs that are difficult to tie to specific units.

---

# PHASE 0: QBO CLEANUP

## Step 0.1: Delete Duplicate Accounts

# PHASE 2: LMB CONFIGURATION

**Important:** You have TWO LMB connections - do Phase 2 for EACH:
- Targon - AMAZON NORTH AMERICA (US)
- Targon - AMAZON EUROPE (UK)

See Appendix F for connection-specific details.

## Step 2.1: Complete Setup Wizard (for EACH connection)

1. Go to LMB → Accounts & Taxes → Setup Wizard
2. Step 1: Select "Custom Chart Accounts"
3. Keep default LMB account mappings (these are fallbacks)
4. Step 2: Verify bank accounts:
   - **US Connection:** Chase Checking (USD) for deposits
   - **UK Connection:** Wise GBP account for deposits
5. Step 3: Confirm tax rates:
   - **US:** No Tax Rate Applicable (marketplace facilitator)
   - **UK:** Standard Rate 20% VAT
6. Complete wizard

## Step 2.2: Create Product Groups

Go to LMB → Inventory → Product Groups

**Create Group 1: US-Dust Sheets**
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Group Name | US-Dust Sheets |
| Sales Account | Amazon Sales - US-Dust Sheets |
| Refunds Account | Amazon Refunds - US-Dust Sheets |
| FBA Fees Account | Amazon FBA Fees - US-Dust Sheets |
| Seller Fees Account | Amazon Seller Fees - US-Dust Sheets |
| Storage Fees Account | Amazon Storage Fees - US-Dust Sheets |
| Advertising Account | Amazon Advertising Costs - US-Dust Sheets |
| Promotions Account | Amazon Promotions - US-Dust Sheets |
| Reimbursement Account | Amazon FBA Inventory Reimbursement - US-Dust Sheets |
| COGS | OFF (Plutus handles) |

**Create Group 2: UK-Dust Sheets**
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Group Name | UK-Dust Sheets |
| Sales Account | Amazon Sales - UK-Dust Sheets |
| Refunds Account | Amazon Refunds - UK-Dust Sheets |
| FBA Fees Account | Amazon FBA Fees - UK-Dust Sheets |
| Seller Fees Account | Amazon Seller Fees - UK-Dust Sheets |
| Storage Fees Account | Amazon Storage Fees - UK-Dust Sheets |
| Advertising Account | Amazon Advertising Costs - UK-Dust Sheets |
| Promotions Account | Amazon Promotions - UK-Dust Sheets |
| Reimbursement Account | Amazon FBA Inventory Reimbursement - UK-Dust Sheets |
| COGS | OFF (Plutus handles) |

## Step 2.3: Assign SKUs to Product Groups

Go to LMB → Inventory → Product Groups → Product SKUs tab

**US-Dust Sheets Group (4 SKUs):**
| SKU | ASIN | Product |
|-----|------|---------|
| CS-007 | B09HXC3NL8 | 6 Pack Plastic |
| CS-010 | B0CR1GSBQ9 | 3 Pack Plastic |
| CS-1SD-32M | B0FLKJ7WWM | 1 Pack Plastic |
| CS-12LD-7M | B0FP66CWQ6 | 12 Pack Plastic |

**UK-Dust Sheets Group (8 SKUs):**
| SKU | ASIN | Product |
|-----|------|---------|
| CS 007 | B09HXC3NL8 | 6 Pack Plastic |
| CS 008 | B0C7ZQ3VZL | 3 Pack Plastic (Light) |
| CS 009 | B0CR1H3VSF | 10 Pack Plastic |
| CS 010 | B0CR1GSBQ9 | 3 Pack Plastic |
| CS 011 | B0DHDTPGGP | 6 Pack Plastic |
| CS 1SD-32M | B0FLKJ7WWM | 1 Pack Plastic |
| CS-CDS-001 | B0CW3N48K1 | Cotton Dust Sheet (Small) |
| CS-CDS-002 | B0CW3L6PQH | Cotton Dust Sheet (Large) |

## Step 2.4: LMB Settings

Go to LMB → Settings → Settlement Settings

**For US Connection (Amazon North America):**
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Product Grouping | ON |
| Fulfillment Type Grouping | OFF |
| Cost of Goods Sold | OFF |

**For UK Connection (Amazon Europe):**
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Product Grouping | ON |
| Fulfillment Type Grouping | OFF |
| Cost of Goods Sold | OFF |
| VAT Scheme | Standard (see Appendix G) |

## Step 2.5: Create "Unassigned" Product Group (Safety Net)

Go to LMB → Inventory → Product Groups

**Create Group: UNASSIGNED**
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Group Name | UNASSIGNED |
| Sales Account | Amazon Sales (parent - no brand suffix) |
| Refunds Account | Amazon Refunds (parent) |
| FBA Fees Account | Amazon FBA Fees (parent) |
| Seller Fees Account | Amazon Seller Fees (parent) |
| Storage Fees Account | Amazon Storage Fees (parent) |
| Advertising Account | Amazon Advertising Costs (parent) |
| Promotions Account | Amazon Promotions (parent) |
| Reimbursement Account | Amazon FBA Inventory Reimbursement (parent) |
| COGS | OFF |

**Set as Default:** In LMB settings, set UNASSIGNED as the default Product Group for unknown SKUs.

**Why:** If a new SKU appears that's not mapped to US-Dust Sheets or UK-Dust Sheets:
- Revenue still posts (not lost)
- Goes to parent accounts (not brand sub-accounts)
- Shows up in reports as "UNASSIGNED" - easy to spot
- You then add the SKU to correct Product Group for future settlements

## Step 2.6: Test LMB

1. Post one settlement manually
2. Check QBO → verify transactions landed in correct brand accounts
3. If wrong accounts → fix Product Group mappings
4. If unmapped SKU → add to correct Product Group

---

# PHASE 3: QBO CUSTOM FIELD SETUP (for Bill Entry)

## Step 3.1: Create Custom Field

1. Go to QBO → Settings → Custom Fields
2. Create a new field named: **"Plutus PO Number"**
3. Check the box for: **Bill** (and Purchase Order if available)
4. Select "Text" as the type
5. Save

**Why Custom Fields instead of Tags:**
- Tags are fragile and being deprecated by Intuit
- Custom Fields are stable and queryable via API
- Plutus will query bills by "Plutus PO Number" to link costs

---

# PHASE 4: BILL ENTRY SOP

## Step 4.1: When New PO is Placed

1. Note the PO number: PO-YYYY-NNN
2. Record PO details (SKUs, quantities, expected costs)
3. You'll enter this PO number in the "Plutus PO Number" custom field on all related bills

## Step 4.2: When Manufacturing Bill Arrives

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Vendor | Actual supplier name |
| Plutus PO Number | PO-YYYY-NNN (Custom Field) |
| Account | Inventory Asset: Manufacturing - [Brand] |
| Line Items | One per SKU with quantity and amount |

**Example:**
```
Vendor: Shenzhen Manufacturing Co
Plutus PO Number: PO-2025-001  ← Custom Field, NOT Tag
Account: Inventory Asset: Manufacturing - US-Dust Sheets

Line 1: CS-007, Qty 500, $1,250.00
Line 2: CS-010, Qty 500, $1,250.00
Total: $2,500.00
```

## Step 4.3: When Freight Bill Arrives

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Vendor | Logistics company |
| Plutus PO Number | PO-YYYY-NNN (same as manufacturing bill) |
| Account | Inventory Asset: Freight - [Brand] |
| Line Items | Total freight amount |

**Example:**
```
Vendor: FastFreight Logistics
Plutus PO Number: PO-2025-001
Account: Inventory Asset: Freight - US-Dust Sheets

Line 1: Ocean freight, $400.00
Total: $400.00
```

## Step 4.4: When Duty Bill Arrives

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Vendor | Customs broker |
| Plutus PO Number | PO-YYYY-NNN (same as manufacturing bill) |
| Account | Inventory Asset: Duty - [Brand] |
| Line Items | Total duty amount |

## Step 4.5: When Land Freight Bill Arrives

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Vendor | Local logistics |
| Plutus PO Number | PO-YYYY-NNN (same as manufacturing bill) |
| Account | Land Freight - [Brand] ← COGS directly, NOT Inventory Asset |
| Line Items | Total amount |

**Note:** Land Freight goes directly to COGS (not Inventory Asset) because:
- It's incurred AFTER goods arrive at 3PL
- It's a fulfillment cost, not a product cost
- Simplifies landed cost calculation

## Step 4.6: When 3PL Storage Bill Arrives

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Vendor | 3PL warehouse |
| Memo | Month identifier (e.g., 3PL-2025-01) |
| Account | Storage 3PL - [Brand] ← COGS directly |
| Line Items | Split by brand based on estimated inventory % |

**Example:**
```
3PL Storage Bill: $500/month
Estimated split: 60% US, 40% UK

Line 1: Storage 3PL - US-Dust Sheets, $300
Line 2: Storage 3PL - UK-Dust Sheets, $200
```

**Note:** 3PL storage goes directly to COGS (not Inventory Asset) because it's a period cost that's difficult to allocate to specific units. Plutus does NOT process this - it's entered manually in QBO.

---

# PHASE 5: PLUTUS DEVELOPMENT

## Step 5.1: Project Setup

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest plutus --typescript --tailwind --app
cd plutus
npm install prisma @prisma/client
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk  # for AI features if needed
npx prisma init
```

## Step 5.3: Core Modules

### Module 1: QBO Integration

```
/lib/qbo/
├── auth.ts          # OAuth2 flow, token refresh
├── client.ts        # API client wrapper
├── accounts.ts      # Account CRUD operations
├── journals.ts      # Journal entry posting
├── bills.ts         # Bill reading/parsing
└── types.ts         # TypeScript types
```

**Developer Note - Bill Querying Limitation:**

The QBO API does NOT support server-side filtering by Custom Fields (e.g., you cannot query `WHERE CustomField = 'PO-123'`).

**Correct Implementation:**
1. Fetch Bills by `TxnDate` range (e.g., last 90 days) or by `Vendor`
2. Filter the results client-side in Node.js to find matching `Plutus PO Number`
3. Cache results to avoid hitting API rate limits

```typescript
// Example: Finding bills for a specific PO
async function getBillsByPO(poNumber: string): Promise<Bill[]> {
  // 1. Fetch all bills from last 90 days
  const bills = await qbo.findBills({
    TxnDate: { $gte: ninetyDaysAgo }
  });

  // 2. Filter client-side by custom field
  return bills.filter(bill =>
    bill.CustomField?.find(f =>
      f.Name === 'Plutus PO Number' && f.StringValue === poNumber
    )
  );
}
```

# PHASE 6: PLUTUS WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION

## Step 6.1: Settlement Processing Flow (SALES ONLY)

**Important:** Settlement processing handles SALES only. Returns are processed separately via FBA Returns Report (see Step 6.2).

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. DETECT NEW SETTLEMENT (Memo-Based Matching)                  │

│    A. Poll QBO:                                                 │
│       - Fetch new Invoices from Vendor = "Link My Books"        │
│       - Or manual trigger from UI                               │
│                                                                 │
│    B. Extract Settlement ID:                                    │
│       - LMB writes Settlement ID in Memo/PrivateNote field      │
│       - Example: "Settlement 14839201"                          │
│       - Parse this to get the Settlement ID                     │
│                                                                 │
│    C. Group by Settlement ID:                                   │
│       - Multiple LMB invoices may share same Settlement ID      │
│       - (happens when LMB splits across months)                 │
│                                                                 │
│    D. Check Status:                                             │
│       - Query Plutus DB for this Settlement ID                  │
│       - If PROCESSED → Ignore (idempotency)                     │
│       - If PENDING → Start processing                           │

│    - Ignore REFUND transactions (handled by Returns flow)       │

│    C. Example: Settlement Dec 27 - Jan 10                       │
│       - LMB creates 2 invoices (Dec 31 + Jan 10)                │
│       - Plutus creates:                                         │
│         → JE #1: Dated Dec 31 (sales Dec 27-31) → Posting #1    │
│         → JE #2: Dated Jan 10 (sales Jan 1-10) → Posting #2     │
│                                                                 │
│    D. Database:                                                 │
│       - Each JE → one SettlementPosting record                  │
│       - Settlement.status = PROCESSED when all postings done    │
│                                                                 │
│    E. Result: COGS matches Revenue month-by-month               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Step 6.2: Returns Processing Flow (SEPARATE FROM SETTLEMENT)

**Why separate:** Settlement REFUND ≠ Physical return. Customer may get refund but keep item (returnless refund). We only reverse COGS when item physically returns to inventory.

**Benefits of separate returns processing:**
- Returnless refunds: No COGS reversal (correct - item is gone)
- Physical returns: COGS reversal only for sellable items
- Damaged returns: No reversal (goes to shrinkage in reconciliation)
- Cleaner audit trail

## Step 6.2: COGS Journal Entry Structure

**Example: Settlement with Sales only**
```
Settlement: 12345678 (Dec 19 - Jan 2)
Currency: USD (but same logic for GBP settlements - COGS always in USD)

DEBITS (COGS):
  Manufacturing - US-Dust Sheets        $1,200.00
  Freight - US-Dust Sheets              $180.00
  Duty - US-Dust Sheets                 $90.00
  Mfg Accessories - US-Dust Sheets      $30.00
  Manufacturing - UK-Dust Sheets        $800.00
  Freight - UK-Dust Sheets              $120.00
  Duty - UK-Dust Sheets                 $60.00
  Mfg Accessories - UK-Dust Sheets      $20.00
                                        ─────────
  Total COGS                            $2,500.00

CREDITS (Inventory Asset):
  Inventory Asset: Manufacturing - US   $1,200.00
  Inventory Asset: Freight - US         $180.00
  Inventory Asset: Duty - US            $90.00
  Inventory Asset: Mfg Accessories - US $30.00
  Inventory Asset: Manufacturing - UK   $800.00
  Inventory Asset: Freight - UK         $120.00
  Inventory Asset: Duty - UK            $60.00
  Inventory Asset: Mfg Accessories - UK $20.00
                                        ─────────
  Total Credit                          $2,500.00

Memo: "Plutus COGS - Settlement 12345678 (Dec 19 - Jan 2, 2026)"
```

**Example: Returns Reversal (from Step 6.2 - FBA Returns Report)**
```
Sellable Return: 2 units of CS-007 @ $2.50 total landed cost

DEBITS (Inventory Asset - cost goes BACK to balance sheet):
  Inventory Asset: Manufacturing - US   $4.00
  Inventory Asset: Freight - US         $0.60
  Inventory Asset: Duty - US            $0.30
  Inventory Asset: Mfg Accessories - US $0.10

CREDITS (COGS - reduces expense):
  Manufacturing - US-Dust Sheets        $4.00
  Freight - US-Dust Sheets              $0.60
  Duty - US-Dust Sheets                 $0.30
  Mfg Accessories - US-Dust Sheets      $0.10

Memo: "Returns reversal - Jan 2026"
```

**Note:** This entry is posted from the FBA Returns Report (Step 6.2), NOT from Settlement processing. Only sellable returns trigger COGS reversal.

**Note:** Storage 3PL and Land Freight are NOT included here - they're posted directly to COGS when billed (see Step 4.5 and 4.6).

## Step 6.3: Monthly Reconciliation Flow

**Developer Note:** The plan references `GET_FBA_MYI_UNSUPPRESSED_INVENTORY_DATA` flat file report. Amazon also offers the FBA Inventory API (`/fba/inventory/v1/summaries`) which provides real-time data and is cleaner to parse. Check the latest SP-API documentation to determine which is best for your use case - the API is actively maintained and may be more reliable than flat file reports.

# PHASE 7: TESTING & VALIDATION

## Step 7.1: Unit Testing

- Test landed cost allocation logic
- Test COGS calculation logic
- Test settlement validation thresholds (OK/WARNING/CRITICAL)
- Test split-month allocation and rounding behavior
- Test journal entry generation

## Step 7.2: Integration Testing

- Test QBO API integration (sandbox)
- Test SP-API integration (sandbox)
- Test end-to-end settlement processing

## Step 7.3: Parallel Run

1. Process 3+ settlements with Plutus
2. Compare Plutus COGS to expected values
3. Verify journal entries posted correctly
4. Verify P&L reports show correct brand breakdown

## Step 7.4: Validation Checklist

| Check | Expected Result |
|-------|-----------------|
| LMB posts to brand accounts | Revenue split by brand |
| Plutus posts COGS journal | COGS split by brand + component |
| P&L by brand | Adds up to 100% of total |
| Inventory Asset balance | Matches expected on-hand value |

---

# PHASE 8: GO-LIVE & OPERATIONS

## Step 8.1: Go-Live Checklist

- [ ] QBO accounts created and verified
- [ ] LMB Product Groups configured
- [ ] LMB SKU assignments complete
- [ ] Test settlement processed successfully
- [ ] Plutus deployed to production
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting set up

## Step 8.2: Ongoing Operations

|------|-----------|-------|
| Process settlements | Per settlement (~biweekly) | Plutus (auto) |
| Run inventory reconciliation | Monthly | Plutus + Accountant |
| Add new SKUs | As needed | Manual (LMB + Plutus) |
| Enter bills | Per PO (~every 2-3 months) | Manual (QBO) |

## Step 8.3: New SKU Procedure

1. SKU appears in settlement (Plutus flags as unknown)
2. Determine brand assignment
3. Add to Plutus: SKU → Brand mapping
4. Add to LMB: Product Groups → Product SKUs
5. Verify next settlement processes correctly

## Step 8.4: New PO Procedure

1. **Define PO:** Assign a number (e.g., `PO-2026-001`)
2. **Bill Entry:** When entering bills in QBO (Manufacturing, Freight, Duty):
   - Enter `PO-2026-001` in the **"Plutus PO Number" Custom Field**
   - Select the correct Inventory Asset account
3. **Verification:** Check Plutus Landed Cost UI to ensure PO is detected and costs are allocated

**Do NOT use QBO Tags for PO tracking - use the Custom Field.**

# APPENDIX E: CRITICAL EDGE CASES

## E.1: Currency Handling & QBO Setup

**QBO Account Configuration:**

| Account Type | Currency Setting | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Income/Expense/COGS | Home Currency (USD) | Cannot set to GBP - QBO doesn't allow it |
| Bank Accounts | Can be GBP | e.g., Wise GBP Account |
| A/R, A/P | Can be GBP | If you have UK vendors/customers |
| Inventory Asset | Home Currency (USD) | Standard QBO accounts |

**Critical:** Do NOT attempt to set "GBP" currency for Income/Expense/COGS accounts. In QBO, these account types are **always in Home Currency (USD)**.

**Plutus Logic:**
- Plutus creates Journal Entries in USD (Home Currency)
- The "Inventory Asset" and "COGS" accounts are standard QBO accounts
- This works because the value of the asset is "trapped" in USD when you buy it
- When you sell in the UK, you're simply moving that USD value from Asset to Expense
- The currency of the sale (GBP) is handled entirely by LMB on the Revenue side

**How it flows:**

1. **Buying inventory:** You pay suppliers in USD. All costs in `SkuCost` table are in **USD**.

2. **Selling (US):**
   - LMB posts revenue in USD
   - Plutus posts COGS in USD
   - Clean match

3. **Selling (UK):**
   - LMB posts revenue (GBP transaction → USD account via QBO FX)
   - Plutus posts COGS in USD (same as US)
   - The GBP sale is handled at transaction level, not account level

**Why this is clean:**
- No currency conversion at COGS posting time
- Inventory Asset is always in USD
- COGS is always in USD
- LMB handles GBP revenue via transaction-level currency
- QBO handles FX translation for reporting

## E.2: Returns Handling (FBA Returns Report)

**Key Insight:** Settlement REFUND ≠ Physical Return

| Scenario | Settlement Report | FBA Returns Report | COGS Action |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Customer returns item | Shows REFUND | Shows RETURN | Reverse COGS ✓ |
| Returnless refund | Shows REFUND | NO entry | No reversal ✓ |
| Item returned damaged | Shows REFUND | Shows RETURN (DAMAGED) | No reversal → Shrinkage |

**Why use FBA Returns Report instead of Settlement:**
- Settlement refunds include "returnless refunds" (customer keeps item)
- We should only reverse COGS when item is actually back in sellable inventory
- FBA Returns Report shows what physically returned and its disposition

**Plutus handling: Use FBA Returns Report (separate from Settlement processing)**

See Step 6.2 for the Returns Processing Flow.

**Journal Entry for Sellable Return:**
```
Return: 2 units of CS-007 @ $2.50 total landed cost
Disposition: SELLABLE

DEBITS (Inventory Asset - cost goes BACK to balance sheet):
  Inventory Asset: Manufacturing - US   $4.00
  Inventory Asset: Freight - US         $0.60
  Inventory Asset: Duty - US            $0.30
  Inventory Asset: Mfg Accessories - US $0.10

CREDITS (COGS - reduces expense):
  Manufacturing - US-Dust Sheets        $4.00
  Freight - US-Dust Sheets              $0.60
  Duty - US-Dust Sheets                 $0.30
  Mfg Accessories - US-Dust Sheets      $0.10
```

**Damaged/Defective Returns:** No COGS reversal. Monthly reconciliation catches these and posts to Inventory Shrinkage.

**Important P&L Timing Note:**

Because we separate Sales (Settlement) from Returns (Physical Receipt), a timing difference will exist on your P&L:

| Month | Event | P&L Impact |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Month A | Customer refunds item. LMB posts Refund expense. | Lower Profit |
| Month B | Item arrives at FBA, marked Sellable. Plutus posts COGS Reversal. | Higher Profit |

**Net Result:** Over time, it balances perfectly. Do not panic if a heavy return month looks less profitable - the inventory credit will arrive when the goods physically return to FBA.

## E.3: Reimbursements Handling

**Scenario:** Amazon loses/damages inventory and reimburses seller.

**What happens:**
1. LMB posts income to Amazon FBA Inventory Reimbursement - [Brand]
2. Inventory is gone (Amazon lost it)
3. But Inventory Asset still has the cost on books

**Plutus handling:**
- During monthly reconciliation:
  1. Pull GET_REIMBURSEMENTS_DATA report
  2. Match reimbursed SKUs to inventory variance
  3. Post adjustment:
     ```
     Debit: Inventory Shrinkage (or specific loss account)
     Credit: Inventory Asset: [Component] - [Brand]
     ```
- The reimbursement income (LMB) offsets the shrinkage expense (Plutus)

## E.4: Unknown SKU in Settlement

**Scenario:** New SKU appears in settlement that Plutus doesn't recognize.

**Handling:**
1. Plutus flags settlement as "NEEDS_ATTENTION"
2. Shows list of unknown SKUs in UI
3. User must:
   - Add SKU to Plutus with brand mapping
   - Add SKU to LMB Product Group
   - Enter landed cost (or mark as $0 if no inventory yet)
4. Reprocess settlement

**Validation:**
- Plutus should validate ALL SKUs are mapped before processing
- Block processing if any unknown SKUs

## E.5: Negative Settlement Total

**Scenario:** Settlement total is negative (fees > sales, or large reserve release).

**Handling:**
- LMB handles this normally (posts negative amounts)
- Plutus still processes COGS based on units sold
- Negative settlement doesn't mean negative COGS
- Units sold is always positive or zero

## E.6: Partial PO / Incomplete Bills

**Scenario:** Manufacturing bill arrives, but freight bill hasn't arrived yet.

**Handling:**
1. Enter manufacturing bill with "Plutus PO Number" Custom Field (e.g., PO-2026-001)
2. Plutus sees incomplete PO (missing freight/duty)
3. Plutus flags PO as "INCOMPLETE" in UI
4. When freight bill arrives, enter with same PO number in Custom Field
5. Plutus recalculates landed cost when all bills present

**Validation rules:**
- PO is "complete" when it has: Manufacturing bill + Freight bill + Duty bill
- User can manually mark PO as "complete" if no duty applies
- Incomplete POs show warning but don't block processing (use last known cost)

## E.7: Cost Method

**Decision: Use WEIGHTED AVERAGE cost method**

**Rationale:**
- Simpler than FIFO for FBA (commingled inventory)
- Amazon doesn't track which specific unit was sold
- Matches how most e-commerce businesses operate

**Implementation:**
- When new PO lands, recalculate weighted average for each component
- Formula: (existing_value + new_value) / (existing_units + new_units)
- Store per-unit cost per component in SkuCost table

**Example:**
```
Existing: 100 units @ $2.00 manufacturing = $200
New PO: 200 units @ $2.50 manufacturing = $500
New weighted average: $700 / 300 units = $2.33/unit
```

## E.8: 3PL Storage & Land Freight (Direct Expenses)

**These costs are NOT capitalized to Inventory Asset:**

| Cost | Why Direct Expense |
|------|-------------------|
| 3PL Storage | Monthly lump sum, not tied to specific PO or units |
| Land Freight | Incurred after goods arrive, fulfillment cost |

**How to handle:**
1. When bill arrives, estimate brand split based on inventory %
2. Post directly to COGS accounts (Storage 3PL - [Brand] or Land Freight - [Brand])
3. Plutus does NOT process these - manual entry in QBO

**Brand Split Estimation:**

## G.1: VAT Background

- UK has 20% standard VAT rate
- Amazon collects VAT on B2C sales (marketplace facilitator)
- LMB separates VAT from gross sales

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| VAT Scheme | Standard |
| Default Tax Rate | 20% Standard |
| Product Groups | May need separate groups for zero-rated items |
