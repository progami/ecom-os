1. https://dev-ecomos.targonglobal.com/hrms/organogram?view=department - chart does not update dynamically

2. Design pub sub based service that we will use across hrms to push email and in app notifications to all the subscribers - note that email notifications should just tell the users to access the app instead of publishing raw notifications

3. We will integrate this pubsub service, across all features in the app which may benifit from a pubsub system. i.e. disciplinary notifciations, reviews, policy updates

4. redesign back to back to reasonable defaults for each page instead of recording the literal journey of each user i.e. do NOT behave like a browser based back

5. Add employee access on this page https://dev-ecomos.targonglobal.com/hrms/employees - remove this feature - and limit imports directly form google admin, so if a new user is created on google admin u should be automatically importing that user

6. Sync both ways between google admin and hrms portal

7. Find attributes that are supposed to be editable by the user that are not critical - so info permissions like phone number, address, etc. have to be filled by the user and critical permissions like roles or project assignment is only editable by their manager and so forth for managers this will repeat until the end (i.e. until u reach the root)

8. permission boundaries have to be designed carefully, and permissions have to flow downward from the root

9. Attributes that are critical need to be defined, like names should not be editable the user itself - but these attributes should come from google admin

10. https://dev-ecomos.targonglobal.com/hrms/organogram?view=project - UIUX between "By Project" , By department by person needs to be aligned and consistent - by person UIUX is good

11. right now Jarrar Amjad is the root, so he should be able to move anyone with absolute permissions - but for regular admins they are able to move people around only under them - so lets say Umair AFzal does not report to anyone i.e. top level - it should technically NOT BE POSSIBLE for another manager who is also top level to move him under him. - only super admin or any manager above him should be able to do that - just like a N-ary Tree


12. FULL REVAMP

This is the **Master Implementation Plan** for your Values-Driven HRMS.

This plan integrates your 4 Core Values (**Courage, Honesty, Integrity, Attention to Detail**) into the logic engine of the system, ensuring that culture is not just a poster on the wall, but the metric by which people are hired, promoted, or fired.

---

###Phase 1: The "Translation Layer" (Data Structure)We stop using generic HR terms in the database and UI. We map everything to your values.

####1. Performance Review SchemaInstead of generic buckets like "Productivity," we create specific buckets that map to your values.

| Database Field | Label in UI | Core Value Link | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rating_precision` | **Quality & Precision** | **Attention to Detail** | 40% |
| `rating_transparency` | **Communication & Transparency** | **Honesty** | 20% |
| `rating_reliability` | **Reliability & Ethics** | **Integrity** | 20% |
| `rating_initiative` | **Ownership & Initiative** | **Courage** | 20% |

####2. Disciplinary SchemaWe add a mandatory "Root Cause" field to every violation record.

* **Field:** `primary_value_breached`
* **Options:** `BREACH_OF_HONESTY`, `BREACH_OF_INTEGRITY`, `BREACH_OF_DETAIL`, `BREACH_OF_COURAGE`.

---

###Phase 2: The Performance Evaluation LogicThis logic runs whenever a review is submitted. It calculates the score and applies the "Culture Guardrails."

####Step A: Calculate Raw Score####Step B: Apply "The Values Veto" (The Competent Jerk Filter)This handles the edge case where someone is high-performing but toxic.

* **Logic:** IF (`rating_transparency` < 3 OR `rating_reliability` < 3)
* **Result:** The Max Possible `Final Score` is capped at **2.9** (Needs Improvement).
* **UI Feedback:** *"Despite high technical output, this employee’s score is capped due to low scores in Core Values (Honesty/Integrity)."*

####Step C: The "New Hire" CalibrationThis handles the edge case where it is unfair to rate deep character traits too early.

* **Logic:** IF (`employment_duration` < 90 days)
* **Result:** Disable `rating_initiative` (Courage) and `rating_reliability` (Integrity). Re-distribute weight to **Attention to Detail (80%)** and **Honesty (20%)** (Attendance/Reporting).

---

###Phase 3: The Disciplinary Logic (Severity Matrix)The system automatically categorizes the severity of a violation based on *which* value was breached.

| Violation Context | Value Breached | System Severity Assignment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recurring Mistakes, Sloppy Work | **Attention to Detail** | **Minor / Moderate** (Training Issue) |
| Avoiding difficult tasks, Hiding bad news | **Courage** | **Moderate** (Coaching Issue) |
| Lying, Falsifying records | **Honesty** | **Major / Critical** (Character Issue) |
| Theft, Harassment, Toxic Behavior | **Integrity** | **Critical** (Zero Tolerance) |

**The Logic Rule:**
A breach of **Honesty** or **Integrity** carries a 2x multiplier on "Standing Damage" compared to a breach of Detail or Courage.

---

###Phase 4: The "Traffic Light" Standing (Real-Time Status)This is the computed status displayed on the employee dashboard.

####🟢 Green: "Role Model"* **Condition:** No Active Violations AND Last Review > 3.5.
* **Requirement:** Must have scored > 3 in *Honesty* and *Integrity* specifically.

####🟡 Yellow: "Misaligned / Coaching"* **Condition A (Skill Gap):** Active Minor/Moderate Violation for *Attention to Detail*.
* **Condition B (Growth Gap):** Review Score between 2.5 - 3.5.
* **System Action:** Suggests "Training Plan" rather than "Disciplinary Action."

####🔴 Red: "Cultural Mismatch"* **Condition A:** Any Active Violation for *Honesty* or *Integrity*.
* **Condition B:** "Values Veto" triggered in performance review.
* **Condition C:** Review Score < 2.5.
* **System Action:** Blocks Promotion/Raise workflows. Suggests PIP or Termination.

---

###Phase 5: User Interface Flows####1. The Manager Review Interface* **Side-by-Side View:** Employee Self-Rating vs. Manager Rating.
* **The "Why" Prompt:** If Manager gives a low score on *Integrity* or *Honesty*, a text box appears: *"Low scores in core values require specific examples. Please describe the incident."*

####2. The Violation Reporting Form* **Question 1:** "Describe the incident."
* **Question 2:** "Which Core Value was primarily compromised?" (Dropdown: Courage, Honesty, Integrity, Detail).
* **Question 3:** "Did the employee take ownership?" (Yes/No).
* *Logic:* If "No", and value is "Honesty", severity escalates automatically.



####3. The Dashboard WidgetA simple card on the Admin Dashboard:

* **Header:** "Cultural Health"
* **Metric:** % of employees in Green Standing.
* **Alert:** List of employees currently in "Red" due to *Integrity/Honesty* breaches (High Priority Risk).

---

###Implementation Roadmap1. **Database Migration:** Add `value_breached` enum and rename review columns to match the 4 values.
2. **Logic Utility:** Create `calculateStanding(employee)` function that implements the "Values Veto" and weighting logic.
3. **Review Form:** Update the UI to group questions under the 4 Value Headers.
4. **Violation Form:** Add the "Root Cause" value selector.

This system effectively filters out "Competent Jerks" (Red) and identifies "Honest Incompetents" for training (Yellow), ensuring your company grows around its core identity.
